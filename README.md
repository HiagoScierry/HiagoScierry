# Hi, I'm Hiago! 👋

### Senior Software Engineer | Transitioning into DevOps & SRE

I am an experienced Software Engineer with a strong background in building complex, high-scale systems. Currently, I am evolving my career towards the DevOps and SRE culture, bridging the gap between software engineering and infrastructure automation to create resilient and scalable solutions.

### 🛠️ What I'm focusing on:
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Deep-diving into AWS architecture and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to build high-availability environments.
- **HomeLab & Kubernetes:** Maintaining a personal lab with a **Kubernetes** cluster to experiment with orchestration, Service Mesh, and Ingress Controllers, tackling real-world challenges of managing on-prem/VPS environments.
- **CI/CD & Reliability:** Designing continuous delivery pipelines that prioritize reliability and process automation, focusing on delivery culture rather than just tools.
- **Autonomous Projects:** Scaling **hiauto.ia**, an AI-driven lead qualification and intelligence platform designed to adapt to any market sector.

### 🧪 Tech Stack:
- **Languages & Backend:** Python, Go, Node.js (TypeScript), C#, PHP, and Java.
- **Infra & DevOps:** AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions.
- **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, and CloudWatch.

### 🎯 2026 Goals:
- Graduate and solidify my international career transition into a DevOps/SRE role.
- Expand the architecture and reach of **hiauto.ia**, applying cutting-edge automation to customer engagement.
